If you want to generate a signed bundle so it can be uploaded to the OSS
Sonatype repository, you will need to do 1 build and run the test cases and
if they pass then run:

./deploy


You will need to enter the passphrase for your private GPG key at some point.
Please do not forget to distribute it to hkp://pgp.mit.edu if the signed
bundle is to be accepted in Maven Central!
